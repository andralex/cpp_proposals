* Dealing with splice-specifier as non-type template argument
* concept-id stuff might not be complete
* Missing type_tuple_size and type_tuple_element
* enums for some other library functions (like getting linkage and storage duration?)
* access_context: default ctor for static factory
* consider nested_{type,value} functions?
